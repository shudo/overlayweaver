	It identifies routing requests to the same target ID
	from various threads.

	* src/ow/messaging/emulator/EmuMessageReceiver.java
	Emulator Messaging service executes MessageHandler#postProcess()
	directly instead of submitting it to a thread pool.

	* src/ow/routing/frtchord/FRTChord.java

	* src/ow/mcast/impl/McastImpl.java
	Fixed a bug.

	Thanks Ryohei Banno <r_banno at complex.eng.hokudai.ac.jp>.

	* src/ow/routing/pastry/Pastry.java
	A Pastry node checks and updates its leaf set periodically.
	This process is not described in any paper.

2010-11-13  Kazuyuki Shudo  <shudo@computer.org>

	Jetty was updated from 7.1.5 to 7.1.6.

	* src/ow/messaging/{Message,tcp/{ConnectionPool,TCPMessage{Receiver,Sender},TCPMessagingConfiguration}}.java
	TCP Messaging service closes connections on both sides,
	a receiver and a sender by timeout.
	This change solves a reported problem in which
	half-closed connections in CLOSE_WAIT state remain
	and they consume descriptors.
	A receiver did not close connections and the problem was raised.
	The problem could be worked around
	by setting a lower value to /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time.
	But it is not a good solution
	because tcp_keepalive_time is a system-wide parameter.
	Thanks Susanna Martinelli <susanna.martinelli at isti.cnr.it>.

	* src/ow/messaging/tcp/ConnectionPool.java
	Fixed the judgment on whether the pool is full or not.

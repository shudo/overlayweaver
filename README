Overlay Weaver - An Overlay Construction Toolkit

About
-----

Overlay Weaver is an overlay construction toolkit, which supports
overlay algorithm designers in addition to application developers.

For application developers, the toolkit provides a common API for
higher-level services such as distributed hash table (DHT) and
multicast.  Applications relying on the common API depend no specific
transport protocol, database implementation and routing algorithm.

The toolkit provides multiple routing algorithms, Chord, Kademlia,
Koorde, Pastry, Tapestry and FRT-Chord.  These algorithms could be
implemented only in hundreds lines of code because of routing layer
decomposition.  Routing layer under the higher-level services has been
decomposed into multiple components, routing driver, routing algorithm
and messaging service.  The decomposition also facilitates
implementation of a new algorithm.  A newly implemented algorithm can
be tested, evaluated and compared on emulator, which can host hundreds
of thousands of virtual nodes. It enables large-scale emulation and
fair comparison between algorithms.
